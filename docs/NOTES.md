# Session Notes

## 2026-01-21 - README/CLAUDE.md Restructure and /retro Skill

**Accomplished**: Restructured documentation (README sections, CLAUDE.md organization), created /retro skill replacing /notes, improved test and apply output clarity, expanded local dev instructions, added VS Code tasks for source testing.

**Key Learnings**:

- `dotfiles-test` runs from installed location; use VS Code task or direct path for testing source changes
- `chezmoi state delete-bucket --bucket=scriptState` forces re-run of run_once scripts
- Git workflow: always suggest commits for approval, never commit directly without explicit user consent
