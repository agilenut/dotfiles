Review this session and consolidate learnings into persistent artifacts.

## Process

1. **Analyze Session**

   - What tasks were accomplished?
   - What problems were encountered and solved?
   - What workarounds or gotchas were discovered?
   - What worked well or poorly in our interactions?
   - Were there repeated patterns that suggest a new skill would help?

2. **Identify Improvements**

   - Project CLAUDE.md: New patterns, gotchas, workflow tips
   - Global CLAUDE.md: Communication/workflow preferences learned
   - Skills: New commands needed, refinements to existing
   - Settings (.claude/settings.local.json): Permission patterns that should be pre-approved

3. **Propose Changes**
   Present proposed updates for each file before making changes.
   Group by file and show what will change.

4. **Write NOTES.md**
   After approved changes, prepend brief session summary to project docs/NOTES.md (newest first).
