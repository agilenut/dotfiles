## Tasks

1. **Update project CLAUDE.md** (if it exists):
   - Add patterns, gotchas, or context discovered
   - Keep it concise and actionable
   - Don't duplicate what's already there

2. **Write/append to NOTES.md** in the project root:
   - Summarize what was accomplished
   - Key learnings from this session
   - Suggestions that would have made the work smoother/faster
   - Context useful across sessions but not suited for CLAUDE.md

## Session: [Date] - [Brief Topic]

### Accomplished
- Item 1
- Item 2

### Learnings
- Learning 1
- Learning 2

### Suggestions
- Suggestion 1
